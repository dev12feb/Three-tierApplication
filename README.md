# 3-Tier Architecture Infrastructure with Terraform on Azure Cloud 🚀

This repository contains Terraform code to deploy a 3-Tier Architecture infrastructure on Azure Cloud, including Development, QA, and Production environments. The infrastructure includes load balancer and Key Vault concepts for secure and scalable deployment.

## Prerequisites 📋

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- An Azure subscription
- Terraform installed on your local machine
- Azure CLI installed (for authentication and Azure resource management)
- Access to Azure Portal for managing resources

## Architecture Overview 🏗️

The architecture follows a typical 3-Tier model:

1. **Presentation Tier**: Front-end applications accessible to users.
2. **Application Tier**: Business logic and application processing.
3. **Data Tier**: Backend data storage and management.

Additionally, the infrastructure includes:

- **Load Balancer**: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances for scalability and fault tolerance.
- **Key Vault**: Securely stores and manages sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and certificates.

## Terraform Modules Used 🛠️

1. `azure_rm_virtual_network`: Manages virtual networks.
2. `azure_lb`: Deploys Azure Load Balancer.
3. `azure_key_vault`: Sets up Azure Key Vault.
4. Other relevant Azure modules as per your requirements.

## Directory Structure 📁

- **environments**: Contains configurations for each environment.
- **modules**: Reusable Terraform modules for each tier.
- **main.tf**: Main Terraform configuration file.
- **variables.tf**: Definition of Terraform variables used across the infrastructure.

## Usage ⚙️

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the desired environment directory (`development`, `qa`, or `production`).
3. Modify the `terraform.tfvars` file to customize your deployment.
4. Run `terraform init` to initialize the Terraform environment.
5. Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes.
6. Run `terraform apply` to apply the changes and deploy the infrastructure.

## Configuration ⚙️

Ensure you customize the following configurations:

- Virtual network CIDRs and subnets.
- Load balancer settings such as SKU, frontend IP configurations, and backend pools.
- Key Vault access policies and secrets.

## Security Considerations 🔒

- Ensure that access to Key Vault and other sensitive resources is properly restricted.
- Use Azure Managed Identity or Service Principal for Terraform authentication.
- Regularly rotate secrets stored in Key Vault.

## Maintenance 🛠️

- Regularly update Terraform modules and Azure provider versions.
- Monitor infrastructure for any anomalies or performance issues.
- Implement automated testing and continuous integration for infrastructure changes.
